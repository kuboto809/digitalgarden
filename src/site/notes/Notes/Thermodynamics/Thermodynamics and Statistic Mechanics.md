# 1. The ensemble
lets consider a system which has energy $\epsilon$ connected with a reservoir, which has energy $E-\epsilon$. There can be heat exchange between them. From what we have learnt, we know that the macrostate is more likely to happen if it is corresponding to a lot of microstate. Now we limit our system to have only 1 microstate, that is,$\Omega(\epsilon) = 1$.
From what we have said, we obtain
$P(\epsilon)\propto \Omega(E-\epsilon)\times1$ 
where $\Omega(E-\epsilon)$ is the amount of microstate that the reservoir has when it is in the energy state of $E-\epsilon$.
